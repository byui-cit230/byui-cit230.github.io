    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>In this lesson's application assignment we will work on the home page (<em><strong>index.html</strong></em>) for
        the Weather Site. This home page will display general information about our three towns. The assignment follows
        the activity that you completed in the <em>Prepare</em> module of this lesson to populate the content areas
        with an outside JSON data source. This data source contains information such as the average rainfall, current
        population, and a list of town events.</p>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Create the weather site home page (<em><strong>index.html</strong></em>) using the <a href="https://byui.instructure.com/courses/10157/modules/items/506824"
                target="_blank" rel="noopener">weather site planning document</a> and your web site planning document
            as a guide. Store this page in the <em><strong>lesson-9</strong></em> folder of your <strong><em>assignments</em></strong>
            directory and be sure to include the supportive folders and files that support this weather site assignment
            update.</li>
        <li>Create a <strong>wireframe sketch</strong> of the home page for the large and small views using any viable
            software tool. You will be responsible for the design and content of the main area of the home page. Post
            this sketch or its URL to the <a title="W09 Topic Discussion: Developer Forum" href="https://byui.instructure.com/courses/10157/discussion_topics/117067">Developer
                Forum</a> for peer review and discussion.

                <p><a href="https://wireframe.cc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wireframe.cc</a> is a free, online
                    tool that allows you to save and share your

            </div>
        </li>
        <li>Your home page should contain a section displaying all three towns with the provided data and <strong>include
            images</strong> displayed in three columns in the large view and a single column in the small view. Use CSS flex or CSS Grid to achieve the layout.<br> The following screenshot is an example of the large view using other town data: <br /><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"

                alt="Home Page Town Data Layout Example" /><br /></li>
        <li>Read in the town statistical data for all three towns from the given JSON data source. Display the
            individual town data with the <strong>motto, year founded, population, and annual rainfall</strong> from
            the JSON file on your home page. Use the lesson's activity as your guide to read in the data and display on
            the page.
