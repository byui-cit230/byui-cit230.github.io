      <h1>Syllabus: WDD 230 - Web Frontend Development</h1>
      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>This course focuses on contemporary front-end web design and development technologies and the application of those technologies in building web sites. When planning, designing, and developing websites and applications, successful web developers consider the purpose, the target audience, the structure, the organization, the user interface, the site usability, the content, the layout, and the visual (aesthetic) design. This course will teach you to plan, design, and develop websites that conform to web standards while following best practices for positive user experiences using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and other relevant frontend technologies.</p>

        <p>
          <img class="profile smallimage right" src="images/frontend-dev.jpg" alt="Frontend Developer Working">&#9757;&nbsp; The assigned activities and assignments are of the applied nature in this course which is unlike traditional academic courses that soley assess students on taking tests and writing assignments/papers. The course is a technical, hands-on class, that is more closely tied to industry by requiring deliverables that meet functional and developmental specifications. This course will require between 9&ndash;15 hours of time per week depending upon your experience and understanding of basic computer operations, file management,  systems, design, and the core technologies. Even though it requires hard work, you will be successful as long as you plan and use your time and the available resources wisely. Plan on
          teaching and/or discussing with someone face-to-face, regularly throughout the entire course on the topics
          you learn directly and indirectly as this regularly activity will help you learn the material at a greater
          depth.</p>

      <h2>Course Theme</h2>
      <img class="profile right mediumimage" title="King Benjamin" src="https://media.ldscdn.org/images/media-library/gospel-art/book-of-mormon/king-benjamin-addresses-people-39650-gallery.jpg"
          alt="King Benjamin Addresses His People by Gary L. Kapp">
      <p>
        In Mosiah 4, King Benjamin counsels the people to &ldquo;impart of our substance to others and do all things in wisdom and order.&rdquo; BYU-Idaho follows a structured learning model of preparing, teaching one another, and pondering and proving. As such, the course theme is based upon <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/4?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mosiah 4:15,</a>&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;But ye will teach them to walk in the ways of truth and soberness; ye will teach them to love one another, and to serve one another&rdquo;</em> and <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/4?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mosiah 4:27</a>, <em>&ldquo;And see that all these things are done in wisdom and order; for it is not requisite that a man should run faster than he has strength. And again, it is expedient that he should be diligent, that thereby he might win the prize; therefore, all things must be done in order.&rdquo;</em> Let us commmit to being taught by the Holy Ghost, understanding our own strengths and weaknesses, and go forward with confidence in doing our best.</p>
      <h2>Learning Model Architecture</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Students will participate in regular learning patterns each week.</li>
        <li>Students will prepare by completing the overview, assigned readings, and hands-on activities.</li>
        <li>Students will teach one another by participating in peer reviews of work, developer discussion boards, and
          student presentations.</li>
        <li>Students will ponder by applying and correlating the principles to their discipline and work-based learning
          opportunities.</li>
        <li>Students will prove by completing knowledge assessments and programming projects, some with well-defined
          specifications and others with less definition.</li>
        <li>This course attempts to balance the concepts of hands-on training with professional, academic education,
          both of which are essential parts of lifelong learning and success in the industry.</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Assessments and Grading</h2>
      <p>Each assessment relates to one or more course objectives and is designed to support a learning outcome. The assessed activities descriptions include grading criteria broken down into specifications that correlate with learning objectives. The student is responsible for understanding the functional and developmental specifications for each assessment. Assessments are tied to course objectives and are assigned to one of the final grade categories, which are weighted. A letter grade will be assigned at the end of the course using a total percentage and standard scale as shown below.</p>
      <div class="warning">
        <p>&#9888;&nbsp; Please note that completing the assignments and activities per the written instructions does not guarantee
          that you will received full credit on the assessment. By definition, full or 'A' level credit is reserved for
          those students who "represent outstanding understanding, application, and integration of subject material and
          extensive evidence of original thinking, skillful use of concepts, and ability to analyze and solve complex
          problems." In addition, the hope is that you will work to demonstrate diligent application of the learning
          model principles, including "initiative in serving other students".<br> <a href="http://www.byui.edu/student-records/grades/grading-system">-BYU-Idaho
